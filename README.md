# Cpp_pricing_library

Welcome, please find my first project of C++ library pricing

I implemented Black&Scholes model to compute European option prices and greeks, including delta, vega, gamma, theta and rho.

I added Monte Carlo pricing simulations, computing same quantities.

Please find the documentation in Pricing_Library_Documentation.pdf
